<h1>Real Quick C++ : Memory Management and all that</h1>

<p>With two programs under our belts, we are practically C++
  experts. But there's more to learn. We need to discuss how to create
  classes that are derived from other classes, pointers and
  references, and memory management.

<h2>My fine inheritance</h2>

<p>In the <a href="classesetal.html">Unigram text classifier
    example</a>, we created one class which did not inherit from
    other classes. Given the way it was written, we could not create
    other classes that could inherit from it. We could have written
    our code so this was the case, of course.

<p>For example, we might have created a more
  general <b>TextClassifier</b> class from which
  our <b>UnigramTextClassifier</b>. Here's a sketch of what
  the <b>TextClassifier</b> header would look like:

<pre class="codeBlock">
#<span class="builtin">ifndef</span> <span class="variable-name">TextClassifier_H</span>
#<span class="builtin">define</span> <span class="variable-name">TextClassifier_H</span>
#<span class="builtin">include</span> <span class="string">&lt;map&gt;</span>
#<span class="builtin">include</span> <span class="string">&lt;iostream&gt;</span>
#<span class="builtin">include</span> <span class="string">&lt;fstream&gt;</span>
<span class="type">namespace</span> <span class="variable-name">TextClassifier</span> 
{
  class TextClassifier 
  {
  <span class="constant">public</span>:

    TextClassifier();
    TextClassifier(<span class="keyword">const</span> string classification);

    <span class="type">unsigned</span> <span class="type">long</span> <span class="function-name">corpusTotal</span>() { <span class="keyword">return</span> my_corpus_total; }
    <span class="comment">/* ... etc ... */</span>
    virtual <span class="type">void</span> <span class="variable-name">TextClassifier</span>::learn(istream&amp; in) =0;

    virtual <span class="type">float</span> <span class="variable-name">TextClassifier</span>::score(istream&amp; in); 
    <span class="comment">/* ... etc ... */</span>
  <span class="constant">private</span>:
    <span class="comment">/*! internal total number of characters in corpus */</span>
    <span class="type">unsigned</span> <span class="type">long</span> <span class="variable-name">_corpus_total</span>;
    <span class="comment">/* ... etc ... */</span>
  };
}
<span class="type">using</span> namespace <span class="variable-name">std</span>;
#<span class="builtin">endif</span> <span class="comment">/* TextClassifier_H */</span>
</pre>

<p>Methods that may be overridden are introduced with 
<span class="keyword">virtual</span>, as in the definition of 
<span class="function-name">score</span>. Methods that <b>must</b> be
defined (like Java's interfaces) are given a 'null' definition by 
defining them as <b>=0</b>,   as in the definition of 
<span class="function-name">learn</span>. 

<p>To create a subclass (a 'derived class,' in C++ jargon), you
declare it with after the <span class="keyword">class</span>
section. Here's an example of what the header for
UnigramTextClassifier might look like:

<pre class="codeBlock">
#<span class="builtin">ifndef</span> <span class="variable-name">UnigramTextClassifier_H</span>
#<span class="builtin">define</span> <span class="variable-name">UnigramTextClassifier_H</span>
#<span class="builtin">include</span> <span class="string">"TextClassifier.h"</span>
<span class="type">namespace</span> <span class="variable-name">TextClassifier</span> 
{
  class UnigramTextClassifier : public TextClassifier 
  {
  <span class="constant">public</span>:

    <span class="comment">/* ... etc ... */</span>

  <span class="constant">private</span>:

    <span class="comment">/* ... etc ... */</span>
  };
}
<span class="type">using</span> namespace <span class="variable-name">std</span>;
<span class="type">using</span> namespace <span class="variable-name">TextClassifier</span>;
#<span class="builtin">endif</span> <span class="comment">/* UnigramTextClassifier_H */</span>
</pre>

<p>C++ allows for multiple inheritance of classes (that is, a class
can be derived from more than one class).

<h2>What's the point?</h2>

<p>No discussion of C++ would be helpful without some discussion of
pointers and references. As we all know, variables have to be stored
somewhere in memory, although typically, we think of a variable in
terms of its <i>value</i> and not its <i>location</i>. A pointer is
simply a variable whose <i>value</i> is a <i>location</i>.

<p>Why do we need to know about pointers? C++ requires us to
constantly consider whether we are dealing with a value or a pointer.

<p>For example, consider the following statements (perhaps from a text
classification program):

<pre class="codeBlock">
    UnigramTextClassifier ut1 = UnigramTextClassifier();
    UnigramTextClassifier ut2 = ut1;
</pre>

<p>In many languages ut1 and ut2 would point to the same value. C++,
on the other hand, has a "copy-by-value" semantics, so ut1 and ut2
are <i>different objects</i>. Similarly,  consider a function such as:

<pre class="codeBlock">
  <span class="type">void</span> <span class="function-name">test</span>(UnigramTextClassifier ut) { } 
</pre>

<p>The <span class="function-name">test</span> function would receive
a <i>copy</i> of the object passed to it ("pass-by-value").

<p>Although at times this may be what we want, it is often <i>not</i>
what we want, and so we need pointers instead (and, we'll see, references). 

<p>Pointers to objects (including the built-in types, such as <span
class="keyword">int</span>s and arrays) are declared using a "*". So, our code block above becomes:

<pre class="codeBlock">
    UnigramTextClassifier  ut = UnigramTextClassifier();
    UnigramTextClassifier* put = &amp;ut;
</pre>

<p>Now, <span class="variable-name">put</span> is a pointer to <span
class="variable-name">ut</span>, and, in some sense they "point to the
same thing." To change the value of what <span
class="variable-name">put</span> points to, we use <b>*put= ...</b>. 

<p>The <b>&amp;</b> means "address of". 

<p>The syntax for accessing methods and fields differs for 'regular'
variables and 'pointer' variables. For regular variables, one appends
the field or method with a "dot." For pointers, one uses "->" (which
is just a bit of syntactic sugar; <b>x->y</b> is the same
as <b>(*x).y</b>). For example:

<pre class="codeBlock">
    UnigramTextClassifier  ut = UnigramTextClassifier();
    UnigramTextClassifier* put = &amp;ut;
    cout << ut.classification() << "; " << put->classification() << endl;
</pre>

<p>Sigh, it's all very confusing, and you need to pay careful
attention. Of course, the compiler will often catch errors for you. 

<p>C++ also allows us to use <b>&amp;</b> to declare reference
variables, using the <b>&amp;</b> for this. This is especially useful
in writing functions and methods, and allow us to pass objects "by
reference" instead of "by value." Again, a short example:

<pre class="codeBlock">
    <span class="type">void</span> <span class="function-name">test</span>(UnigramTextClassifier&amp; ut, UnigramTextClassifier* put)
    {
      cout << ut.classification() << "; " << put->classification() << endl;
    }
</pre>

<p>Note that variables passed by reference use the 'dotted' syntax for access. The classic "swap" routine is:

<pre class="codeBlock">
    <span class="type">void</span> <span class="function-name">swap</span>(<span class="type">int</span>&amp; i, <span class="type">int</span>&amp; j) { <span class="type">int</span> <span class="variable-name">temp</span>=i; i=j; j=temp; }
</pre>
 

<h2>Misty water-colored memory management</h2>

<p>Memory which is dynamically allocated in C++ is not automatically
"garage-collected," and the programmer must carefully manage deleting
dynamically allocated variables. Objects are dynamically created using the 
<span class="keyword">new</span> keyword, and dynamically deleted using the
<span class="keyword">delete</span> keyword. Also, 
<span class="keyword">new</span> objects are returned as
pointers. There are (at least) three strategies for dealing with memory
management. The first strategy is to carefully pair any call to <span
class="keyword">new</span> with a call to <span
class="keyword">delete</span>, which ensuring any additional
references to the <span class="keyword">new</span> objects are set to
"null" (0). For example:

<pre class="codeBlock">
<span class="type">void</span> <span class="function-name">test</span>() 
    { 
      UnigramTextClassifier* put1 = new UnigramTextClassifier();
      UnigramTextClassifier* put2 = put1;
      <span class="comment">/* do some stuff */</span>
      cout << put1->classification();
      <span class="comment">/* do some stuff */</span>
      delete put1;
      put2 = 0;
    }
</pre>

<p>The second strategy is to use a programming idiom called "resource
acquisition is initialization." C++ allows one to
define <i>destructors</i> as well as <i>constructors</i> and
these can be written so that memory is returned at the end of a code block, 
even in the face of exceptions. Again, this is beyond the scope of this
tutorial, but a <a href="http://www.google.com/search?as_q=&num=10&hl=en&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&btnG=Google+Search&as_epq=resource+acquisition+is+initialization">Google search for "resource
acquisition is initialization"</a> will take you futher. (See, for example,
Stroustrup's answer to the question <a href="http://www.research.att.com/~bs/bs_faq2.html#finally">Why doesn't C++ provide a "finally" construct?</a>).


<p>The third strategy is to use a language that provides automatic
garbage collection (including some implementations of C++). (I'm just
being snarky here).
