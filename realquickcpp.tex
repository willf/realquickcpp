\section{Introduction}

A delightful and sprightly introduction.

%Broadly construed, my research interests  are in natural language
%understanding and models of task execution and monitoring. Typically,
%the approach I take to problems in these domains is to investigate how
%to integrate symbolic models with statistical, information
%theoretical, or dynamic data. For example, my dissertation work
%focused on describing and building natural language parsers that could
%be quickly incorporated into computer systems \marginal{Are they \textit{interests} or \textit{something else}?\\ See \urlh{http://www.help.com}{the Help.com site}.}such as intelligent
%tutors and expertise browsers. It described a class of parsing
%technologies (indexed concept parsing) which combined
%information-theoretic and knowledge-based approaches to natural
%language understanding. Several systems based on indexed concept
%parsing have been commercially developed and are in use for web-based
%knowledge management and for tutoring. 

%\begin{verbatim}
% (define fact 
%   (lambda (n)
%     (if (= n 0)
%         1 ; the base case
%         (* n (fact (- n 1))))))
%\end{verbatim}
%                   
%Since 1996, my colleague R. James Firby and I have been investigating
%and building systems that integrate natural language understanding and
%generation, task execution, and recognition of complex event
%patterns. In several NASA SIBIR (Small Business Innovation Research)
%projects, as well as part of a commercial R\&D effort, we have worked
%on representations and algorithms for conceptual memory storage and
%querying, semantically-oriented natural language understanding, and
%dialogue and task execution. This work has resulted in several
%commercial applications for automotive telematics, network and system
%monitoring, and is actively used at NASA's Johnson Space Center for
%several projects. 

%I have been interested in investigating the similarities and
%differences between event recognition and monitoring, and natural
%language understanding. I have created a language for events and event
%pattern recognition that incorporates ideas from  natural language
%parsing which takes into account the multi-channel and often
%non-serial nature of events, while incorporating the hierarchical and
%serial nature of language.  

%\scm{
%(define fact
%"The factorial function"
% (lambda (n)
%     (if (= n 0) 1 ;the base case
%        (* n (fact (- n 1))))))
%}

%These interests have led to ancillary interests in programming
%languages (both as a tool user and a tool design), operating systems
%and distributed computing, cognitive science, linguistics and
%philosophy of language. I am also interested in ``humane computing,''
%that is, the interaction between computational devices and approaches,
%and people and how this should inform design of computational devices.

%Oddly, this has led me to write code that looks like:
%\scm{
%#include <iostream> %using namespace std;
%// an 'enum' is a list of values
%;; Wish I could change the quoting ... but an enum is still a list of values%enum SignalValueType 
% {SignalCharacter, SignalInteger, SignalDouble, SignalLong, SignalBoolean}; %class Signal {%public:%  Signal() {%    theType = SignalInteger;%    ti = 0;%  }%  Signal(int i) {%    theType = SignalInteger;%    ti = i;%  }%  Signal(char ch) {%    theType = SignalCharacter;%    tch = ch;%  }%  Signal(double d) {%    theType = SignalDouble;%    td = d;%  }%  Signal(long l) {%    theType = SignalLong;%    tl = l;%  }%  Signal(bool b) {%    theType = SignalBoolean;%    tb = b;%  }%  bool equals(const Signal& probe) {%    switch (theType) {%    case SignalInteger: %      return (probe.theType==SignalInteger) && (probe.ti==ti);%    case SignalCharacter: %      return (probe.theType==SignalCharacter) && (probe.tch==tch);%    case SignalDouble: %      return (probe.theType==SignalDouble) && (probe.td==td);%    case SignalLong: %      return (probe.theType==SignalLong) && (probe.tl==tl);%    case SignalBoolean: %      return (probe.theType==SignalBoolean) && (probe.tb==tb);%    default: return 0;%    };%  };%private:%  SignalValueType theType;%  union {%    char tch;%    int ti;%    double td;%    long tl;%    bool tb;%  };%};%int main()%{%  Signal s = Signal();%  int ii= 0;%  Signal s1 = Signal(ii);%  Signal bs = Signal(true);%  cout << "Self similar: " << s1.equals(s1) << "\n";%  cout << "Same value: " << s.equals(s1) << "\n";%  cout << "Int is bool " << s1.equals(bs) << "\n";%} %
