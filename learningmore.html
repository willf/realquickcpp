<h1>Learning More</h1>

<p>This real quick guide is really too quick. Here are some
additional references which you'll find useful.</p>

<h2>Of the making of C++ books there is no end</h2>

<p>Here are a few books that you find useful, with links to <a
href="http://www.amazon.com">Amazon.com</a>:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=
"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0201485184">Essential
C++</a> by Stanley B. Lippman. This is an excellent tutorial,
somewhat in the same spirit as the Real Quick tutorial, but much
more complete. (By the way, I would <i>not</i> recommend its
companion volume, <i>Accelerated C++</i>, which seems spotty to me
in its coverage).</li>

<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0201889544">The
C++ Programming Language (3rd Edition)</a> by Bjarne Stroustrup.
Stroustrup is the creator of C++, and this book is a very complete,
generally readable reference book that also makes a reasonable
tutorial introduction if you are already familiar with
programming.</li>

<li><a href=
"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0471164372">Computing
Concepts with C++ Essentials, 3rd Edition</a> by Cay Horstmann. I
got sent this book by mistake (we used Horstmann's Java version of
this book for a intro to programming course I helped teach), but
I'm glad I got it. If you're new to programming, and need to start
by using C++, this is a good book to do it with.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Net Knowledge</h2>

<p>Here are some on-line resources:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.sgi.com/tech/stl/">Standard Template
Library Programmer's Guide</a>. This is an essential on-line guide
and reference to the Standard Template Library. Since the Standard
Template Library is what makes C++ usable, you'll want to review
this site.</li>

<li><a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/">The
cplusplus.com tutorial</a>. A pretty good on-line tutorial, which
doesn't assume you already know C. They also have a relatively
complete reference guide to <a href=
"http://www.cplusplus.com/ref/indexr.html">Standard C++ Library</a>
(i.e., the parts not covered in the STL).</li>

<li><a href=
"http://www.cs.brown.edu/courses/cs032/resources/C++tutorial.html">Java
to C++ Transition Tutorial</a> at Brown University.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Code read</h2>

<p>You might find the code from this tutorial useful. Feel free to
use it at your own risk.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="countch.html">countch.cpp</a> (<a href=
"countch.cpp">text</a> version). Counts and desplays character
frequencies.</li>

<li><a href=
"UnigramTextClassifier_h.html">UnigramTextClassifier.h</a> (<a
href="UnigramTextClassifier.h">text</a> version). <a href=
"UnigramTextClassifier.html">UnigramTextClassifier.cpp</a> (<a
href="UnigramTextClassifier.cpp">text</a> version). Text classifer
class based on unigram frequencies. <a href=
"doc/html/index.html">Doxygen</a> created documentation.</li>

<li><a href="ilearn.html">ilearn.cpp</a> (<a href=
"ilearn.cpp">text</a> version). <a href=
"hamspam.html">hamspam.cpp</a> (<a href="hamspam.cpp">text</a>
version). <a href="Makefile.html">Makefile</a> (<a href=
"Makefile">text</a> version). Learner and classifier for ham vs.
spam, based on UnigramTextClassifier.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Toolin' around</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.doxygen.org/index.html">Doyxgen</a> is a
good documentation tool.</li>

<li><a href="http://cppunit.sourceforge.net/">CppUnit</a> is a good
unit testing suite for C++.</li>

<li>I used the <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/">GNU Compiler
Collection</a> G++ compiler for all of the code in this
tutorial.</li>
</ul>
