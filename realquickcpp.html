<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>This is a tutorial for writing programs in the C++ language.
It's aimed towards people who have experience writing programs in
other languages, such as Java, Python or Lisp.</p>

<p>C++ is a strongly-typed language that supports object-oriented
programming. It was created by Bjarne Stroustrup in order to
provide the C language with objects, and it has the reputation of
allowing the programmer to write object-oriented programs that are
fast (not, you may note, the reputation of allowing the programmer
to write object-oriented programs quickly).</p>

<p>Traditionally (if "traditionally" can be used for something so
recently created), C++ was taught either as the first
object-oriented language students or programmers learned, or as a
step up from C. More and more, however, people are learning
programming by using Java or other languages, and this leaves a gap
to the programmer who knows how to program well, but, for whatever
reason, wants to learn or use C++. This "real, quick" guide to C++
is not a reference guide to C++, but a quick introduction to C++
using realistic programs. It's divided into four sections: first,
we demonstrate C++ by writing a simple (but realistic) program to
count character frequencies in a text; second, we describe how to
define classes and objects in C++ and do a little software
development; third, we discuss memory management and a inheritance;
and fourth, we provide a series of pointers to other resources for
learning C++.</p>

<p>If you have comments or corrections about this C++ tutorial, I'd
be glad to hear them--just write me at <a href=
